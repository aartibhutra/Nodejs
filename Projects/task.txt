WE are designing a REST API using JSON 

ROUTES :
        GET /users - List all users - Done

        GET /users/1 - Get the users ID 1
        GET /users/2 - Get the users ID 2

        POST /users - Create new users 

        PATCH /users/id - Edit the user with ID 
        PATCH /users/1 - Edit the user with ID 1


        DELETE /users/1 - delete the user with ID 1
