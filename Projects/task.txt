WE are designing a REST API using JSON 

ROUTES :
        GET /users - HTML Document render 
        GET /api/users - List all users - Done


        WE can't directly write these routes in the code because we are using a framework that handles this for us.
        Dynamic Path Parameters: 
        represented as : that shows the parameter work as dynamic 
        GET /api/users/:id - done 
        :id -> Variable | Dynamic 

        GET /users/1 - Get the users ID 1 - done 
        GET /users/2 - Get the users ID 2 - done 

        POST /users - Create new users 

        PATCH /users/id - Edit the user with ID 
        PATCH /users/1 - Edit the user with ID 1


        DELETE /users/1 - delete the user with ID 1
